Integration of Solar Energy Systems into EV Charging Stations
Technical project made by me using PV*SOL, SketchUp, AutoCAD and Excel.

The main objective of this project is integrating solar energy systems into EV-charging stations which are gonna be crucial tools for the transportation industry in the near future. 

I've used SketchUp for designing the architectural environment, PV*SOL for solar energy system design, Microsoft Excel for analyzing the output data and AutoCAD for drawing installation projects.
I've modeled 2 scenarios for analyzing the most common cases that we can implement in this project:
- Family House (1x22kW AC // 16,92kWp Installed Power)
- Parking Lot (4x22kW AC // 42,3kWp Installed Power)

Outcomes:
- At House scenario, i've analyzed that the payback time of the investment which has been made for this project is 13.5 years and after that, we can start profiting from our system up to 15 (as guaranteed by JinkoSolar Quality team) years more.
- At the Parking Lot scenario I’ve analyzed that the payback time of the investment which has been made for this project is 6 years and after that, we can start profiting from our system up to 25 years (as guaranteed by the JinkoSolar Quality team) more.

The project report and my presentation are attached at the description but unfortunately, i can't share the files for privacy.

This project is supervised by Elec. Eng. Burak Kürtür and Zorlu Energy EV-Charging Stations Technical Team.
